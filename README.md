# Lightgunverter Inline SCART Breakout
Using this [4 position jack](https://www.arrow.com/en/products/sj-43514-smt-tr/cui-inc) and a standard 3.5mm 4 pole to Yellow, White, Red RCA jacks, you can put this in between your SCART cable and the destination to break out green for the overlay and sync.
Yellow is sync, white goes to the "Video In" jack, and Red goes to the "Video Out" jack.
